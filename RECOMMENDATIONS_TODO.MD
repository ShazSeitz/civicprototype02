# Recommendations Engine Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Testing Framework
- [X] Set up testing library (Jest/Vitest with React Testing Library)
- [X] Create test specifications for priority mapping functions
- [X] Write tests for rule-based lookup functionality
- [X] Implement test cases for candidate matching algorithm
- [X] Create tests for recommendation scoring and ranking
- [X] Set up test fixtures with sample user priorities and expected outputs
- [X] Implement integration tests for the complete recommendation flow

## Phase 2: Mock Implementation
- [X] Create a structured database of mock candidates and their positions
- [X] Implement basic rule-based lookup for matching priorities to policy terms
- [X] Develop priority categorization system (economy, healthcare, etc.)
- [X] Build scoring algorithm for candidate-priority alignment
- [X] Create mock recommendation generator based on alignment scores
- [X] Implement priority conflict detection
- [X] Add randomization factors to simulate real-world variance
- [X] Create fallback mechanisms for unrecognized priorities

## Phase 3: Live Data Integration
- [ ] Design and implement API endpoints for recommendation requests
- [ ] Create data models for candidates, ballot measures, and policies
- [ ] Implement data fetching based on user location (ZIP code)
- [ ] Build caching layer for frequently requested data
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback to mock data when needed
- [ ] Implement logging for recommendation requests and responses
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for monitoring system performance
- [ ] Set up analytics to track recommendation accuracy

## Phase 4: AI Enhancement
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API for priority analysis
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering for consistent LLM responses
- [ ] Create hybrid system that combines rule-based and AI approaches
- [ ] Build feedback mechanism to improve AI recommendations over time
- [ ] Implement user feedback collection on recommendation quality
- [ ] Add sentiment analysis for priority interpretation
- [ ] Create system to learn from user corrections
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and usage monitoring
- [ ] Add fallback to rule-based system when AI is unavailable
- [ ] Set up A/B testing to compare rule-based vs. AI recommendations

## Security and Performance Considerations
- [ ] Implement API key security measures
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API requests
- [ ] Set up monitoring for API usage and costs
- [ ] Optimize recommendation algorithms for performance
- [ ] Implement caching strategies for frequent requests
- [ ] Create backup systems for recommendation data
- [ ] Add logging for security-related events
- [ ] Implement privacy controls for user data
