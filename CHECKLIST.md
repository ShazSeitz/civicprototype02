# VoteInfo App Development Checklist

## Phase 1: Complete Application Flow (MVP Step 1)
- [ ] Review existing screens to understand current implementation
- [ ] Create any missing screens needed for complete flow
- [ ] Implement navigation between all screens
- [ ] Add placeholder data that mimics what the real data will look like
- [ ] Test the complete flow on web before moving to the next phase

## Phase 2: Implement Application Logic (MVP Step 2)
- [ ] Set up testing framework (Vitest or Jest with React Testing Library)
- [ ] Write unit tests for core business logic functions
- [ ] Implement state management (contexts, reducers)
- [ ] Create tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Develop API integration points with tests
- [ ] Test key UI components that handle user interactions
- [ ] Create mocks for API calls and external services
- [ ] Implement error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Ensure application logic works end-to-end with placeholder data

## Phase 3: Integrate LLM Functionality (MVP Step 3)
- [ ] Set up LLM API integration
- [ ] Implement learning capability from user input
- [ ] Create feedback mechanisms for LLM responses
- [ ] Test LLM integration with various user scenarios
- [ ] Optimize LLM performance and response times
- [ ] Implement fallbacks for when LLM is unavailable
- [ ] Ensure security for LLM API keys and user data

## Phase 4: Deploy via Capacitor (MVP Step 4)
- [ ] Add Ionic Framework to the existing project
- [ ] Install and configure Capacitor
- [ ] Build the web app for production
- [ ] Add iOS platform via Capacitor
- [ ] Add Android platform via Capacitor
- [ ] Configure native settings and permissions
- [ ] Test on iOS simulators and devices
- [ ] Test on Android emulators and devices
- [ ] Address platform-specific issues
- [ ] Optimize for mobile performance
- [ ] Prepare for app store submissions

## Additional Considerations
- [ ] Implement offline capabilities
- [ ] Enhance mobile UI for touch interactions
- [ ] Review authentication for mobile contexts
- [ ] Audit API security measures for mobile contexts
- [ ] Set up analytics to track user behavior across platforms
